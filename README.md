### Goal

Demonstrate command of HTML basics

### Reflection

This mostly ended up being a muscle memory trainer. There weren't any big revelations or new discoveries, but it definitely was a nice way to build **familiarity.** I like to test as I learn so I already had the tools (those of which I'm using at this point) down pat, but this was my first scratch-to-finish HTML project with a goal in mind. 

So with that being said, I'd say the biggest way I improved doing this was obtaining a firmer grasp on the general workflow of this kind of... well, *work.* To pick a couple other learning points: git practice (especially commit messages), code formatting, and a motivation boost from the high of seeing instant results [and just **developing** {haha, don't crucify me} the ability to make an idea come to life is an amazing feeling].
