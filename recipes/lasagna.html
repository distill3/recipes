        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna has always been a favorite in our household—there&rsquo;s something comforting about the way it pulls apart, layers of noodles, cheese, and sauce blending together. This one? Well, it's not your typical lasagna. It&rsquo;s a bit rustic, you might say. I remember the first time I made it, the sauce ended up a <em>little darker than usual</em>, but it added such a rich depth to the flavor, almost... earthy. The cheese melted in this interesting way, forming these little pockets that stretched as you pulled the slices apart—<em>not perfect</em>, but that&rsquo;s the charm, right? The noodles had this slightly curled edge, almost like they&rsquo;d been waiting just a bit longer in the oven than they should have.</p>
        <p>But that&rsquo;s what makes cooking fun, those little <strong>quirks</strong> that give each dish its personality. When I serve this lasagna, it&rsquo;s never quite the same as the last time—always a little <strong>different</strong>, always a little <strong>unique</strong>. It&rsquo;s not the prettiest dish, but there's something about it that keeps <em>drawing you back</em>.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
